## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootsrap
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles



### Useful resources

- [Boostrap Grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/grid/) - This helped me to create responsive cards. Bootstrap’s grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. It’s built with flexbox and is fully responsive. Below is an example and an in-depth explanation for how the grid system comes together. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/modal/) - Bootstrap’s JavaScript modal plugin to add dialogs to your site for lightboxes, user notifications, or completely custom content.
